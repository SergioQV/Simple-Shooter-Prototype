# Simple-Shooter-Prototype
This is the code for the "Simple Shooter" project. Full project must be asked for, due to space problems.<br>
The aim of the project was to learn to create more complex controllers and AIs and to practice with the C++ syntax.<br>

#Demo
This is the link to the Demo. WASD for moving, SpaceBar to jump and mouse-left-click to shoot. To quit, must be closed from outside.
